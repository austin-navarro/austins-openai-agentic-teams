# Log: 2024-03-25 -- Image Generator Agent Implementation

**Agent**: DevelopmentAgent-001  
**Command/Input**: "Implement the Image Generator Agent using DALL-E 2"

**What was implemented**:  
- Created Image Generator Agent class with DALL-E 2 integration
- Implemented robust error handling and retries
- Set up proper logging system
- Added image cleanup functionality
- Created requirements.txt with dependencies

**Implementation Details**:
1. Core Components:
   - DALL-E 2 client setup with proper error handling
   - Smart prompt engineering system
   - Configurable image settings (size, quality, style)
   - Automatic directory management
   - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

2. Key Features:
   - Async image generation with DALL-E 2
   - Dynamic prompt generation
   - Consistent image dimensions (1792x1024, suitable for 1200x675 display)
   - Error handling with retries
   - Automatic cleanup of old images

3. Integration Points:
   - Async interface for Orchestrator integration
   - Standardized output paths in media/ directory
   - Clear success/failure status reporting
   - Consistent mediaId usage

**Technical Decisions**:
1. Used async/await for better performance
2. Implemented retry mechanism using tenacity
3. Used pathlib for robust file handling
4. Added logging for debugging and monitoring
5. Created cleanup utility for maintenance

**Dependencies Added**:
```
openai>=1.0.0
tenacity>=8.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
aiohttp>=3.8.0
pillow>=10.0.0
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement the Orchestrator Agent
2. Create integration tests
3. Add image validation
4. Consider adding image post-processing

**Resolved Questions**:
- Prompt engineering: Implemented structured approach
- Retry strategy: Using exponential backoff
- File management: Using pathlib with proper error handling
- Logging: Comprehensive logging system implemented

**Remaining Questions**:
- Image quality validation methods
- Integration testing strategy
- Performance monitoring approach
- Rate limiting implementation details
