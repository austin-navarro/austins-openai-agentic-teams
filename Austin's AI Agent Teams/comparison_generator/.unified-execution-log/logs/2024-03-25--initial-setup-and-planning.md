# Log: 2024-03-25 -- Initial Setup and Planning

**Agent**: SystemArchitect-001  
**Command/Input**: "Set up Comparison Generator Agent Framework with image generation capabilities"

**What it did**:  
- Created Unified Execution Log (UEL) structure
- Documented project overview and priorities
- Analyzed existing codebase components
- Planned integration of DALL-E 2 for image generation

**Why it did it**:  
- Need centralized documentation for multi-agent system
- Ensure clear tracking of decisions and progress
- Establish foundation for scalable comparison generation
- Selected DALL-E 2 for superior control and capabilities

**Current State**:
- Existing Components:
  - Comparison Generator Agent (functional)
  - outputs/ directory (set up)
  - Basic project structure
- Pending Components:
  - Orchestrator Agent
  - Image Generator Agent
  - media/ directory

**Next Steps**:
1. Create media/ directory for image storage
2. Implement Image Generator Agent with DALL-E 2
3. Develop Orchestrator Agent for workflow management
4. Set up integration tests

**Technical Considerations**:
- Image Generation:
  - Format: Horizontal (1200x675px)
  - Storage: media/ directory
  - Naming: Using mediaId for consistency
- File Structure:
  - JSON output format for CMS compatibility
  - Consistent naming convention across all files
  - Clear separation of concerns between agents

**Open Questions**:
- Image prompt templating strategy
- Error handling between agents
- Retry mechanisms for failed generations
- Rate limiting for API calls
