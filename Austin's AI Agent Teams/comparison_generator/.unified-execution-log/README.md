# Comparison Generator Agent Framework - Unified Execution Log

## Project Overview
A multi-agent system that generates comparison blogs with corresponding images, ready for ingestion into Payload CMS. The system handles orchestration, content generation, image generation, and output file organization.

## Current Priorities
1. Implement Image Generator Agent using DALL-E 2
2. Create Orchestrator Agent
3. Set up media/ directory for image storage
4. Integrate all agents into a cohesive workflow

## System Components
- âœ… Comparison Generator Agent
- ðŸ”„ Orchestrator Agent (In Progress)
- ðŸ”„ Image Generator Agent (In Progress)
- âœ… outputs/ directory
- ðŸ”„ media/ directory (Pending)

## Project Structure
```
/agents
  /orchestratorAgent.py
  /comparisonAgent.py
  /imageAgent.py

/outputs
  [comparison-files].json

/media
  [comparison-images].jpg

```

## Implementation Status
- [x] Comparison Generator Agent
- [x] outputs/ folder setup
- [ ] media/ folder creation
- [ ] Orchestrator Agent implementation
- [ ] Image Generator Agent implementation
- [ ] Integration testing

## Technical Decisions
- Using DALL-E 2 for image generation due to:
  - More control in prompting
  - Support for edits and variations
  - Higher throughput capability
- JSON-based output format for CMS compatibility
- Unique mediaId system for file naming consistency
